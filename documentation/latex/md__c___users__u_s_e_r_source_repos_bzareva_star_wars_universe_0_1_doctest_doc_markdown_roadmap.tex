\item better testing of the library
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item unit test the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_string}{String}} class
\item should unit test internals -\/ currently even if a bug is caught by different output it\textquotesingle{}s very difficult to track the reason
\item should test stuff that should not compile
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/ldionne/dyno/blob/master/cmake/CompileFailTest.cmake}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/ldionne/dyno/blob/master/cmake/\+Compile\+Fail\+Test.\+cmake}}
\item see slide 38 here -\/ \href{https://github.com/boostcon/cppnow_presentations_2017/blob/master/05-19-2017_friday/effective_cmake__daniel_pfeifer__cppnow_05-19-2017.pdf}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/boostcon/cppnow\+\_\+presentations\+\_\+2017/blob/master/05-\/19-\/2017\+\_\+friday/effective\+\_\+cmake\+\_\+\+\_\+daniel\+\_\+pfeifer\+\_\+\+\_\+cppnow\+\_\+05-\/19-\/2017.\+pdf}}

\item minimize the use of the preprocessor
\item remove backwards-\/compatible macros for the fast asserts
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_roadmap_autotoc_md157}{}\doxysubsection{Things that are being considered but not part of the roadmap yet\+:}\label{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_roadmap_autotoc_md157}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item add ability to print a diff for strings/values instead of the whole 2 versions (gtest does that)
\item add LIKELY \& friends for the conditions of asserts -\/ look at BOOST\+\_\+\+LIKELY, ppk\+\_\+assert, foonathan/debug\+\_\+assert, etc
\item ability for users to register their own command line options and access them later on
\item fix this\+: \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1292}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/catchorg/\+Catch2/issues/1292}}
\item Fake\+It mocking integration -\/ like \href{https://github.com/eranpeer/FakeIt/tree/master/config/catch}{\texttt{ catch}} (also checkout \href{https://github.com/ujiro99/doctest-sample}{\texttt{ this}})

\item rpm package? like this\+: \href{https://github.com/vietjtnguyen/argagg/blob/master/packaging/rpm/argagg.spec}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/vietjtnguyen/argagg/blob/master/packaging/rpm/argagg.\+spec}}
\item get the current test case/section path -\/ \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/522}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/catchorg/\+Catch2/issues/522}}
\item when no assertion is encountered in a test case it should fail -\/ and should also add a SUCCEED() call
\item failure reporting should print out previous SECTIONs for data-\/driven testing -\/ as requested \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/734}{\texttt{ here}}
\item {\ttfamily Bitwise()} class that has overloaded operators for comparison -\/ to be used to check objects bitwise against each other
\item detect floating point exceptions
\item checkpoint/passpoint -\/ like in \href{http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_63_0/libs/test/doc/html/boost_test/test_output/test_tools_support_for_logging/checkpoints.html}{\texttt{ boost test}} (also make all assert/subcase/logging macros to act as passpoints and print the last one on crashes or exceptions)
\item queries for the current test case -\/ name (and probably decorators)
\item support for Lib\+Identify
\item add CHECKED\+\_\+\+IF \& friends\+: \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1278}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/catchorg/\+Catch2/issues/1278}}
\item support for running tests in parallel in multiple threads
\item death tests -\/ as in \href{https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/advanced.md\#death-tests}{\texttt{ google test}}
\item config options
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item test case name uniqueness -\/ reject the ones with identical names
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item command line options
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item ability to specify ASC/\+DESC for the order option
\item global timeout option (per test or per entire session?)
\item command line error handling/reporting
\item option to not print context info when the --success option is used
\item ability for the user to extend the command line -\/ as requested \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/622}{\texttt{ here}}

\item option for filters to switch from \char`\"{}match any\char`\"{} to \char`\"{}match all\char`\"{} mode
\item option to list test suites and test cases in a tree view
\item add a \char`\"{}wait key\char`\"{} option (before and after tests) -\/ as requested \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/477\#issuecomment-256417686}{\texttt{ here}}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item decorators for test cases and test suites-\/ like in boost test
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item depends\+\_\+on
\item precondition
\item fixture
\item label (tag) -\/ with the ability to have multiple labels (tags) for a test case and also the ability to list them
\item run X times (should also multiply with (or just override) the global test run times)
\item throw an exception when incompatible decorators are given in the same list of decorators -\/ like may\+\_\+fail and should\+\_\+fail
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item setup / teardown support
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item global setup / teardown -\/ can be currently achieved by providing a custom main function
\item per test suite (block? only? and not all blocks of the same test suite?)
\item as decorators
\item see how it\textquotesingle{}s done in boost test -\/ with the fixture decorator
\item perhaps for fixtures in addition to the constructor / destructor -\/ since throwing in the destructor might terminate the program
\item or just ignore all of this this -\/ it would require globals or classes and inheritance -\/ and we already have subcases
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item doctest in a GUI environment? with no console? APIs for attaching a console? querying if there is one? \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/configuration.md\#stdout}{\texttt{ investigate...}}
\item runtime performance
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item look at this\+: \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues/1086}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/catchorg/\+Catch2/issues/1086}}
\item startup -\/ the set holding all registered tests should use a specialized allocator to minimize program startup time
\item optimize the mutex lock\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{http://preshing.com/20111124/always-use-a-lightweight-mutex/}{\texttt{ http\+://preshing.\+com/20111124/always-\/use-\/a-\/lightweight-\/mutex/}}

\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item ability to provide a temp folder that is cleared between each test case
\item make the \+\_\+\+MESSAGE assert macros work with variadic arguments -\/ and maybe write the ones for binary/unary asserts as well
\item move from operator \char`\"{}$<$$<$\char`\"{} to \char`\"{}$<$=\char`\"{} for capturing the left operand when decomposing binary expressions with templates
\item think about silencing warnings about unused variables when DOCTEST\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+DISABLE is used -\/ see commit 6b61e8aa3818c5ea100cedc1bb48a60ea10df6e8 or issue \#61
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item also this\+: {\ttfamily (void)(true ? (void)0 \+: ((void)(expression)))}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item think about optionally using {\ttfamily $<$typeinfo$>$} and libcxxabi for demangling so users don\textquotesingle{}t have to use {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{doctest_2doctest_8h_a8245b61f7381307d76a1472436d35ebe}{TYPE\+\_\+\+TO\+\_\+\+STRING()}}}
\item handle more complex expressions -\/ {\ttfamily CHECK(foo() == 1 $\vert$$\vert$ \mbox{\hyperlink{foo_8h_ad8a2dfa8cbec508ec4cf97b2c5452797}{bar()}} == 2);}
\item add \mbox{[}\mbox{[}noreturn\mbox{]}\mbox{]} to Message\+Builder\+::react() -\/ and actually make a separate function (react2) for the \mbox{\hyperlink{doctest_2doctest_8h_ac8d1eaf65528f86b445cf6e45b2d72c9}{FAIL()}} case
\item think about using a string view of some sorts
\item benchmark against google test and boost test
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_roadmap_autotoc_md158}{}\doxysubsection{Things that are very unlikely to enter the roadmap\+:}\label{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_roadmap_autotoc_md158}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item rethink static code analysis suppressions -\/ users shouldn\textquotesingle{}t have to use the same flags for code which uses doctest macros/types
\item move the \char`\"{}react()\char`\"{} part (the one that throws for REQUIRE asserts -\/ or for when \char`\"{}abort-\/after=$<$int$>$\char`\"{} is reached) to a function call in the while() part of the asserts
\item stop using underscores for the beginning of identifiers -\/ the anonymous variables -\/ against the standard...
\item templated fixture test cases
\item test with missed warning flags for GCC
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\item \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/pull/903}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/catchorg/\+Catch2/pull/903}}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item handle {\ttfamily wchar} strings???
\item hierarchical test suites -\/ using a stack for the pushed ones
\item ability to specify the width of the terminal in terms of characters (for example 60 -\/ less than 80 -\/ the default)
\item ability to re-\/run only newly compiled tests based on time stamps using {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+\+DATE\+\_\+\+\_\+} and {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+\_\+\+TIME\+\_\+\+\_\+} -\/ stored in some file
\item add underscores to all preprocessor identifiers not intended for use by the user
\item put everything from the {\ttfamily detail} namespace also in a nested anonymous namespace to make them with internal linkage
\item ability to put everything from doctest into an anonymous namespace -\/ to allow the use of multiple different versions of {\bfseries{doctest}} within the same binary (executable/dll) -\/ like the \href{https://github.com/nothings/stb}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{stb}}}} libraries can
