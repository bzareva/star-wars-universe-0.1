{\bfseries{doctest}} works quite nicely without any command line options at all -\/ but for more control a bunch are available.

{\bfseries{Query flags}} -\/ after the result is printed the program quits without executing any test cases (and if the framework is integrated into a client codebase which \mbox{\hyperlink{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_main}{$\ast$$\ast$supplies it\textquotesingle{}s own \`{}\`{}\`{}main()\`{}\`{}\`{} entry point$\ast$$\ast$}} -\/ the program should check the result of {\ttfamily should\+Exit()} method after calling {\ttfamily run()} on a {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classdoctest_1_1_context}{doctest\+::\+Context}}} object and should exit -\/ this is left up to the user).

{\bfseries{Int/\+String options}} -\/ they require a value after the {\ttfamily =} sign -\/ without spaces! For example\+: {\ttfamily -\/-\/order-\/by=rand}.

{\bfseries{Bool options}} -\/ they expect {\ttfamily 1}/{\ttfamily yes}/{\ttfamily on}/{\ttfamily true} or {\ttfamily 0}/{\ttfamily no}/{\ttfamily off}/{\ttfamily false} after the {\ttfamily =} sign -\/ but they can also be used like flags and the {\ttfamily =value} part can be skipped -\/ then {\ttfamily true} is assumed. ~\newline


{\bfseries{Filters}} use wildcards for matching values -\/ where {\ttfamily $\ast$} means \char`\"{}match any sequence\char`\"{} and {\ttfamily ?} means \char`\"{}match any one character\char`\"{}. To pass a pattern with an interval use {\ttfamily \char`\"{}\char`\"{}} like this\+: {\ttfamily -\/-\/test-\/case=\char`\"{}$\ast$no sound$\ast$,vaguely named test number ?\char`\"{}}.

All the options can also be set with code (defaults/overrides) if the user \mbox{\hyperlink{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_main}{$\ast$$\ast$supplies the \`{}\`{}\`{}main()\`{}\`{}\`{} function$\ast$$\ast$}}.

All the flags/options also come with a prefixed version (with {\ttfamily -\/-\/dt-\/} at the front by default) -\/ for example {\ttfamily -\/-\/version} can be used also with {\ttfamily -\/-\/dt-\/version} or {\ttfamily -\/-\/dt-\/v}.

The default prefix is {\ttfamily -\/-\/dt-\/}, but this can be changed by setting the \href{configuration.md\#doctest_config_options_prefix}{\texttt{ $\ast$$\ast${\ttfamily DOCTEST\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+OPTIONS\+\_\+\+PREFIX}$\ast$$\ast$}} define.

All the unprefixed versions listed here can be disabled with the \href{configuration.md\#doctest_config_no_unprefixed_options}{\texttt{ $\ast$$\ast${\ttfamily DOCTEST\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+NO\+\_\+\+UNPREFIXED\+\_\+\+OPTIONS}$\ast$$\ast$}} define.

This is done for easy interoperability with client command line option handling when the testing framework is integrated within a client codebase -\/ all {\bfseries{doctest}} related flags/options can be prefixed so there are no clashes and so that the user can exclude everything starting with {\ttfamily -\/-\/dt-\/} from their option parsing.

If there isn\textquotesingle{}t an option to exclude those starting with {\ttfamily -\/-\/dt-\/} then the {\ttfamily dt\+\_\+removed} helper class might help to filter them out\+:
