Vankata is a big fan of Star Wars, so he decided to make a small project on OOP on this topic. For the purpose, he wants to recreate the universe of the series.~\newline
 He first started with the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jedi}{Jedi}}, deciding that everyone should have\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item jedi name
\item ank, the following are arranged in ascending order -\/ YOUNGLING, INITIATE, PADAWAN, KNIGHT-\/\+ASPIRANT, KNIGHT, MASTER, BATTLE\+\_\+\+MASTER Ð¸ GRAND\+\_\+\+MASTER
\item age
\item the color of the lightsaber (a string entered by keyboard)
\item force (set by some number of type double)~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}

He then decided to create the planets and moons, each with a name and a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jedi}{Jedi}}, who inhabit it. Create an application that supports the following commands\+:~\newline



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+add\+\_\+planet \mbox{[}planet\+\_\+name\mbox{]}\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Adds a new planet.~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}

$\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+create\+\_\+jedi \mbox{[}planet\+\_\+name\mbox{]} \mbox{[}jedi\+\_\+name\mbox{]} \mbox{[}jedi\+\_\+rank\mbox{]} \mbox{[}jedi\+\_\+age\mbox{]} \mbox{[}saber\+\_\+color\mbox{]} \mbox{[}jedi\+\_\+strength\mbox{]}\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 The function brings out a message whether the addition was successful or not (there is a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jedi}{Jedi}} with such a name on this or that planet, or not there is a planet with such a name).~\newline



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+remove\+Jedi \mbox{[}jedi\+\_\+name\mbox{]} \mbox{[}planet\+\_\+name\mbox{]}\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 The function brings out a message whether the removal was successful or not (the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jedi}{Jedi}} did not inhabits this planet).~\newline

\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+promote\+\_\+jedi \mbox{[}jedi\+\_\+name\mbox{]} \mbox{[}multiplier\mbox{]}\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Raises the given \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jedi}{Jedi}} by one rank up in ladder and increases its strength by the formula jedi\+\_\+strength + = (multiplier $\ast$ jedi\+\_\+strength) (cannot be increased any more) of rank GRAND\+\_\+\+MASTER and must be multiplier positive number of type double).~\newline

\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+demote\+\_\+jedi \mbox{[}jedi\+\_\+name\mbox{]} \mbox{[}multiplier\mbox{]}\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Decreases the rank of the given \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jedi}{Jedi}} by one rank down the ladder and lowers its strength by formula jedi\+\_\+strength -\/= (multiplier $\ast$ jedi\+\_\+strength) (cannot be lowered further of rank YOUNGLING and multiplier must be positive number of type double).~\newline

\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+get\+\_\+strongest\+\_\+jedi \mbox{[}planet\+\_\+name\mbox{]}\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Outputs information about the strongest \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jedi}{Jedi}} of the submitted planet (with the greatest force).~\newline

\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+get\+\_\+youngest\+\_\+jedi \mbox{[}planet\+\_\+name\mbox{]} \mbox{[}jedi\+\_\+rank\mbox{]}\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Brings out the youngest \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jedi}{Jedi}} inhabiting the given planet and has the corresponding rank ({\bfseries{if they are more than one, to display the first on alphabetical order if none will be displayed appropriate message}}).~\newline

\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+get\+\_\+most\+\_\+used\+\_\+saber\+\_\+color \mbox{[}planet\+\_\+name\mbox{]} \mbox{[}jedi\+\_\+rank\mbox{]}\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Returns the most common color to light sword in the given rank of the respective planet.~\newline

\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+get\+\_\+most\+\_\+used\+\_\+saber\+\_\+color \mbox{[}planet\+\_\+name\mbox{]}\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Returns the most common color to light sword planet which is used by at least one {\bfseries{GRAND\+\_\+\+MASTER}}.~\newline

\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+print \mbox{[}planet\+\_\+name\mbox{]}\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Bring out of the name of the planet appropriately and the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jedi}{Jedi}} inhabiting it, {\bfseries{sorted first in growing order by rank, then by second key -\/ lexicographically by name}}.~\newline

\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+print \mbox{[}jedi\+\_\+name\mbox{]}\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Brings out of the information about the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jedi}{Jedi}} appropriately, as well as which planet it currently inhabits.~\newline

\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+\mbox{[}planet\+\_\+name\mbox{]} + \mbox{[}planet\+\_\+name\mbox{]}\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Outputs on the screen in sorted type({\bfseries{lexicographically}}) information about the inhabitants the two \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jedi}{Jedi}} planets.~\newline

\end{DoxyItemize}

Vankata also wanted to be able to keep the information which he input in the program for later and be able to load it again. That is, the program must store information on the planet and the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_jedi}{Jedi}} inhabiting them {\bfseries{in a file}} and to supports commands for working with files described in the working with the {\bfseries{command line section. All commands are lowercase latin letters, and the arguments are separated by one interval.}}~\newline
~\newline


The program allows you to perform various transformations on the files in given session. When session transformations are applied, they apply for all loaded images for the current session. Transformations are applied over images only after the \char`\"{}save\char`\"{} or \char`\"{}saveas\char`\"{} command is executed. The \char`\"{}save\char`\"{} command saves all loaded in the current user session images after applying all transformations, and the \char`\"{}saveas\char`\"{} command saves under the new name only the image that was loaded first.~\newline
 Once the application opens a file, it can perform the following operations\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+open\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Loads the contents of a file. If one does not exist, a new one is created with empty content. All other commands can be executed only if there is a successfully loaded file. Once the file is opened and read, it closes and your application no longer needs to work with it, unless the user does not want to save the changes made again (see the save command below), in which case the file must be reopened. To do this, you must select an appropriate presentation of the information in the file. If your application detects an error while loading the data, it should display an appropriate error message and terminate its execution.~\newline
~\newline
 Example\+:~\newline
 {\bfseries{cmd\+:}} open C\+:\textbackslash{}\+Temp\textbackslash{}file.xml~\newline
 {\itshape Successfully opened file.\+xml}~\newline
~\newline

\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+close\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Closes the currently open document. Closing clears the currently loaded information and then the program cannot execute commands other than opening a file (Open).~\newline
~\newline
 Example\+:~\newline
 {\bfseries{cmd\+:}} close~\newline
 {\itshape Successfully closed file.\+xml}~\newline
~\newline

\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+save\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Saves done changes back to the same file from which the data was read.~\newline
~\newline
 Example\+:~\newline
 {\bfseries{cmd\+:}} save~\newline
 {\itshape Successfully saved file.\+xml}~\newline
~\newline

\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+saveas\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Saves done changes to a file, also allowing the user to specify its path.~\newline
~\newline
 Example\+:~\newline
 {\bfseries{cmd\+:}} saveas \char`\"{}\+C\+:\textbackslash{}\+Temp\textbackslash{}another file.\+xml\char`\"{}~\newline
 {\itshape Successfully saved another file.\+xml}~\newline
~\newline

\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+help\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Outputs brief information about the commands supported by the program.~\newline
 {\bfseries{cmd\+:}} help {\itshape The following commands are supported\+:~\newline
 open \mbox{[}file\mbox{]} opens \mbox{[}file\mbox{]}~\newline
 close closes currently opened file~\newline
 save saves the currently open file~\newline
 saveas \mbox{[}file\mbox{]} saves the currently open file in \mbox{[}file\mbox{]}~\newline
 help prints this information~\newline
 exit exists the program}~\newline
~\newline

\item $\ast$$\ast$\+\_\+exit\+:\+\_\+$\ast$$\ast$~\newline
 Exit the program.~\newline
~\newline
 Example\+:~\newline
 {\bfseries{cmd\+:}} exit~\newline
 {\itshape Exiting the program...}~\newline
~\newline
