This library is free, and will stay free but needs your support to sustain its development. There are lots of \mbox{\hyperlink{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_roadmap}{$\ast$$\ast$new features$\ast$$\ast$}} and maintenance to do. If you work for a company using {\bfseries{doctest}} or have the means to do so, please consider financial support.

Consider opening an issue for a discussion before making a pull request to make sure the contribution goes smoothly.

All pull requests should be made against the {\ttfamily dev} branch because the {\ttfamily master} is the stable one with the latest release.

If you\textquotesingle{}re going to change something in the library itself -\/ make sure you don\textquotesingle{}t modify {\ttfamily doctest/doctest.\+h} because it\textquotesingle{}s generated from {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{doctest__fwd_8h}{doctest/parts/doctest\+\_\+fwd.\+h}}} and {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{doctest_8cpp}{doctest/parts/doctest.\+cpp}}} -\/ they get concatenated by CMake -\/ so make sure you do a CMake build after you modify them so the {\ttfamily assemble\+\_\+single\+\_\+header} target gets built. Also take into consideration how the change affects the code coverage -\/ based on the project in {\ttfamily examples/all\+\_\+features}. Also update any relevant examples in the {\ttfamily examples} folder.

This framework has some design goals which must be kept. Make sure you have read the \mbox{\hyperlink{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_features}{$\ast$$\ast$features and design goals$\ast$$\ast$}} page.

If your changes also change the output of the library -\/ you should also update the reference output for the tests or otherwise the CI builds ({\ttfamily travis} and {\ttfamily appveyor}) will fail when they compare the latest output to the outdated reference output (which is committed in the repository). To do this run CMake with the {\ttfamily DOCTEST\+\_\+\+TEST\+\_\+\+MODE} variable set to {\ttfamily COLLECT} (making the new reference output) and then run {\ttfamily ctest} and commit the changed (or newly created) {\ttfamily .txt} files in the {\ttfamily test\+\_\+output} folders too. The default {\ttfamily DOCTEST\+\_\+\+TEST\+\_\+\+MODE} is {\ttfamily COMPARE}.

Example\+: {\ttfamily cmake -\/DDOCTEST\+\_\+\+TEST\+\_\+\+MODE=COLLECT path/to/sources \&\& cmake -\/-\/build . \&\& ctest}

Code should be formatted with a recent-\/enough {\ttfamily clang-\/format} using the config file in the root of the repo (or I will do it...)

Testing with compilers different from GCC/\+Clang/\+MSVC (and more platforms) is something the project would benefit from.
