Most test frameworks have a large collection of assertion macros to capture all possible conditional forms ({\ttfamily \+\_\+\+EQUALS}, {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+NOTEQUALS}, {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+GREATER\+\_\+\+THAN} etc).

{\bfseries{doctest}} is different (but it\textquotesingle{}s like \href{https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{Catch}}}} in this regard). Because it decomposes comparison expressions most of these forms are reduced to one or two that you will use all the time. That said, there is a rich set of auxiliary macros as well.

There are 3 levels of assert severity for all assertion macros\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily REQUIRE} -\/ this level will immediately quit the test case if the assert fails and will mark the test case as failed.
\item {\ttfamily CHECK} -\/ this level will mark the test case as failed if the assert fails but will continue with the test case.
\item {\ttfamily WARN} -\/ this level will only print a message if the assert fails but will not mark the test case as failed.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The {\ttfamily CHECK} level is mostly useful if you have a series of essentially orthogonal assertions and it is useful to see all the results rather than stopping at the first failure.

All asserts evaluate the expressions only once and if they fail -\/ the values are \mbox{\hyperlink{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_stringification}{$\ast$$\ast$stringified$\ast$$\ast$}} properly.

Since {\bfseries{doctest}} is \href{faq.md\#is-doctest-thread-aware}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{thread-\/safe}}}} all asserts and \mbox{\hyperlink{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_logging}{$\ast$$\ast$logging$\ast$$\ast$}} macros can be used in threads spawned from test cases.

Note that the {\ttfamily REQUIRE} level of asserts uses exceptions to end the current test case. It might be dangerous to use this level of asserts inside destructors of user-\/defined classes -\/ if a destructor is called during stack unwinding due to an exception and a {\ttfamily REQUIRE} assert fails then the program will terminate. Also since C++11 all destructors are by default {\ttfamily noexcept(true)} unless specified otherwise so such an assert will lead to {\ttfamily std\+::terminate()} being called.\hypertarget{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_assertions_autotoc_md50}{}\doxysection{Expression decomposing asserts}\label{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_assertions_autotoc_md50}
These are of the form {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{doctest__fwd_8h_a836cca6b6ed3a1706353f6d1bca0935f}{CHECK(expression)}}} (Same for {\ttfamily REQUIRE} and {\ttfamily WARN}).


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ \{expression```\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{If an exception is thrown it is caught, reported, and counted as a failure (unless the assert is of level ```WARN```).}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{Examples:}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{```c++}
\DoxyCodeLine{CHECK(flags == state::alive | state::moving);}
\DoxyCodeLine{CHECK(thisReturnsTrue());}
\DoxyCodeLine{REQUIRE(i < 42);}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Negating asserts -\/ {\ttfamily $<$LEVEL$>$\+\_\+\+FALSE(expression)} -\/ evaluates the expression and records the {\itshape logical NOT} of the result.
\end{DoxyItemize}

These forms exist as a workaround for the fact that {\ttfamily !} prefixed expressions cannot be decomposed properly.

Example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ \{c++\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{REQUIRE\_FALSE(thisReturnsFalse());}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Using the \href{configuration.md\#doctest_config_super_fast_asserts}{\texttt{ $\ast$$\ast${\ttfamily DOCTEST\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+SUPER\+\_\+\+FAST\+\_\+\+ASSERTS}$\ast$$\ast$}} config option can make compilation of asserts up to \href{benchmarks.md\#cost-of-an-assertion-macro}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{31-\/63\%}}}} faster!
\item These asserts also have a {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+MESSAGE} form -\/ like {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{doctest__fwd_8h_a73e7aad74289b7337329539f44cd9a97}{CHECK\+\_\+\+MESSAGE(expression, message)}}} which is basically a code block {\ttfamily \{\}} with a scoped \href{logging.md\#info}{\texttt{ $\ast$$\ast${\ttfamily INFO()}$\ast$$\ast$}} logging macro together with the {\ttfamily CHECK} macro -\/ that way the message will be relevant only to that assert. The binary/unary asserts don\textquotesingle{}t have this variation yet.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Examples\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ \{c++\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{INFO("{}this is relevant to all asserts, and here is some var: "{}, local);}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{CHECK\_MESSAGE(a < b, "{}relevant only to this assert "{}, other\_local, "{} more text!"{});}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{CHECK(b < c); // here only the first INFO() will be relevant}

One may use the \href{configuration.md\#doctest_config_void_cast_expressions}{\texttt{ $\ast$$\ast${\ttfamily DOCTEST\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+VOID\+\_\+\+CAST\+\_\+\+EXPRESSIONS}$\ast$$\ast$}} config identifier to cast the expression in these asserts to void to avoid warnings or other issues -\/ for example nodiscard statements whose result isn\textquotesingle{}t checked. This will however limit the ability to write entire {\ttfamily \{\}} blocks of code as the expression (or multiple statements) but in that case a simple lambda can be used. This should have been the default behavior from day 1 of the framework...\hypertarget{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_assertions_autotoc_md53}{}\doxysection{Using asserts out of a testing context}\label{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_assertions_autotoc_md53}
Asserts can be used outside of a testing context (in code not called from a {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{doctest_2doctest_8h_a8bc255ff55721571e878568d2b5dcb35}{TEST\+\_\+\+CASE()}}}) instead of \href{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/assert}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily assert()}}}.

A {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classdoctest_1_1_context}{doctest\+::\+Context}}} object still has to be created somewhere and set as the default one using the {\ttfamily set\+As\+Default\+For\+Asserts\+Out\+Of\+Test\+Cases()} method -\/ and then asserts will work. A handler can be registered by calling the {\ttfamily set\+Assert\+Handler()} method on the context object. If no handler is set then {\ttfamily std\+::abort()} is called on failure.

The results would be best when using the \href{configuration.md\#doctest_config_super_fast_asserts}{\texttt{ $\ast$$\ast${\ttfamily DOCTEST\+\_\+\+CONFIG\+\_\+\+SUPER\+\_\+\+FAST\+\_\+\+ASSERTS}$\ast$$\ast$}} config identifier.

Checkout the \href{../../examples/all_features/asserts_used_outside_of_tests.cpp}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{example}}}} showcasing how that is done. For more information see the \href{https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/issues/114}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{issue for the feature request}}}}.

Currently \mbox{\hyperlink{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_logging}{$\ast$$\ast$logging macros$\ast$$\ast$}} cannot be used for extra context for asserts outside of a test run. That means that the {\ttfamily \+\_\+\+MESSAGE} variants of asserts are also not usable -\/ since they are just a packed {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{doctest_2doctest_8h_aedf01192151e10a6620567952711ff69}{INFO()}}} with an assert right after it.\hypertarget{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_assertions_autotoc_md54}{}\doxysection{Floating point comparisons}\label{md__c___users__u_s_e_r_source_repos_bzareva_star_wars_universe_0_1_doctest_doc_markdown_assertions_autotoc_md54}
When comparing floating point numbers -\/ especially if at least one of them has been computed -\/ great care must be taken to allow for rounding errors and inexact representations.

{\bfseries{doctest}} provides a way to perform tolerant comparisons of floating point values through the use of a wrapper class called {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classdoctest_1_1_approx}{doctest\+::\+Approx}}}. {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classdoctest_1_1_approx}{doctest\+::\+Approx}}} can be used on either side of a comparison expression. It overloads the comparisons operators to take a relative tolerance into account. Here\textquotesingle{}s a simple example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ \{c++\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{REQUIRE(performComputation() == doctest::Approx(2.1));}

\end{DoxyCode}


By default a small epsilon value (relative -\/ in percentages) is used that covers many simple cases of rounding errors. When this is insufficient the epsilon value (the amount within which a difference either way is ignored) can be specified by calling the {\ttfamily epsilon()} method on the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classdoctest_1_1_approx}{doctest\+::\+Approx}}} instance. e.\+g.\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ \{c++\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{REQUIRE(22.0/7 == doctest::Approx(3.141).epsilon(0.01)); // allow for a 1\% error}

\end{DoxyCode}


When dealing with very large or very small numbers it can be useful to specify a scale, which can be achieved by calling the {\ttfamily scale()} method on the {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{classdoctest_1_1_approx}{doctest\+::\+Approx}}} instance.
