# Star Wars Universe 0.1
## *Brief information*

Vankata is a big fan of Star Wars, so he decided to make a small project on OOP on this topic.
To this end, he wants to recreate the universe of the series.<br/>
He first started with the Jedi, deciding that everyone should have: 
- jedi name
- ank, the following are arranged in ascending order - YOUNGLING,
INITIATE, PADAWAN, KNIGHT-ASPIRANT, KNIGHT, MASTER, BATTLE_MASTER Ð¸ GRAND_MASTER
- age
- the color of the lightsaber (a string entered by keyboard) 
- force (set by some number of type double)<br/> 

He then decided to create the planets and moons, each with a name and a Jedi, who inhabit it.
Create an application that supports the following commands:<br/> 

 - **_add_planet [planet_name]:_**<br/>
Adds a new planet.<br/>

- **_create_jedi [planet_name] [jedi_name] [jedi_rank] [jedi_age] [saber_color] [jedi_strength]:_**<br/>
The function to display a message whether the addition was successful or not
(there is a Jedi with such a name on this or that planet, or not there is a planet with such a name).<br/>

- **_removeJedi [jedi_name] [planet_name]:_**<br/>
The function to display a message whether the removal was successful or not (the Jedi did not inhabits this planet).<br/> 

- **_promote_jedi [jedi_name] [multiplier]:_**<br/>
-
