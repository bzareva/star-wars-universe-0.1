# Star Wars Universe 0.1
## *Brief information*

Vankata is a big fan of Star Wars, so he decided to make a small project on OOP on this topic.
To this end, he wants to recreate the universe of the series.<br/>
He first started with the Jedi, deciding that everyone should have: 
- jedi name
- ank, the following are arranged in ascending order - YOUNGLING,
INITIATE, PADAWAN, KNIGHT-ASPIRANT, KNIGHT, MASTER, BATTLE_MASTER Ð¸ GRAND_MASTER
- age
- the color of the lightsaber (a string entered by keyboard) 
- force (set by some number of type double)<br/> 

He then decided to create the planets and moons, each with a name and a Jedi, who inhabit it.
Create an application that supports the following commands:<br/> 

 - **_add_planet <planet_name>:_**<br/>
